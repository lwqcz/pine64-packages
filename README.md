This repository is only a way how to stash packages changed from its original state to support aarch64 aka arm64 on my Pine A64+ SBC, where I am also testing them and use them on daily basis.

I am not the author of original code and I am no violating any copyright and so on.

Please refer to original authors like @flighware @mutability flightradar24.com.

I hope that thse packages will help and/or inspire you :-)

Take care ...
